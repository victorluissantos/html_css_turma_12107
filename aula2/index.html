						<b>Lorem Ipsum</b> is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the <i>1960s</i> with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently <u>with desktop</u> publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
